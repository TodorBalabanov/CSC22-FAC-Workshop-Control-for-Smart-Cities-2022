\begin{abstract}
Distributed computing and volunteer computing became very popular in the last two decades. Both are used for problems easily separable for simultaneous calculations on many heterogeneous machines. The only difference is that volunteer computing has been done on a donated calculating power. With the rise of smart mobile devices, volunteer computing appeared in the world of mobile distributed computing. With its capabilities, Android OS became an attractive environment for such computations. Android's content providers became a valuable tool for information transfer in mobile distributed computing applications.

\section{Introduction}

Fast after its appearance mobile distributed computing become a part as state of the art in the soft computing \cite{Angelova-2009-a} and even more with Covid-19 pandemic \cite{Petrov-2021-a}. The ideas applied in the wireless sensor networks \cite{Alexandrov-2016-a} has been influenced the ideas of computations distribution on mobile devices and even integration with IoT \cite{Dineva-2019-a} with smart routing \cite{Tashev-2019-a}. Splitting calculations in heterogeneous devices appears to be efficient in complex problems like combinatorial problems \cite{Borissova-2015-a}. Having calculations on devices under somebody else control except advantages also rises many cybersecurity issues \cite{Dimitrov-2021-a}.
